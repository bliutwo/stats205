## Solution to Problem 1

>We say that two observations $X_1$ and $X_2$ are *independent* of one another with respect to a collection of events $\mathcal{A}$ if
>
>\[
>     Pr\left\{X_1 \in A \textnormal{  and  } X_2 \in B\right\} = Pr\left\{X_1 \in A \right\}Pr\left\{X_2 \in B\right\}
>\]
>where A and B are any two not necessarily distinct sets of outcomes belonging to $\mathcal{A}^3$.

>In deciding whether your own observations are exchangeable and a permutation test applicable, the key question is the one we posed in the very first chapter: Under the null hypothesis of no differences among the various experimental or survey groups, can we exchange the labels on the observations without significantly affecting the results?
