## Solution to Problem 1

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(cars)
head(cars)
cars.supsmu = supsmu(cars$speed, cars$dist, bass = 0, span = "cv")
cars.supsmu2= supsmu(cars$speed, cars$dist, bass = 0, span = .30)
cars.supsmu3= supsmu(cars$speed, cars$dist, bass = 0, span = .05)

plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist, main = "Stopping distances for various speeds", xlab = "Speed", ylab = "Stopping Distance")
lines(x = cars.supsmu$x, y = cars.supsmu$y, col = "green")
legend(5, 110, legend=c("Super Smoothed Cars Data with 'cv' span"),
 col=c("green"), lty=1:1, cex=0.8)
